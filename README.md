## üí° Quickstart

#### Installation
Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/ZulutionAI/MoviiGen1.1.git
cd MoviiGen1.1
```

1. Install dependencies:
```
# Ensure torch >= 2.4.0
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Install [FastVideo](https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/FastVideo) according to their instructions.

#### Model Download

T2V-14B  Model: ü§ó [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/ZuluVision/MoviiGen1.1) 
MoviiGen1.1 model supports both 720P and 1080P. For more cinematic quality, we recommend using 1080P and a 21:9 aspect ratio (1920*832).

Download models using huggingface-cli:
```
pip install "huggingface_hub[cli]"
huggingface-cli download ZuluVision/MoviiGen1.1 --local-dir ./MoviiGen1.1
```
## üé• Inference

Inference without prompt extend:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/inference/generate.py --ckpt_dir ./MoviiGen1.1 --prompt "Inside a smoky, atmospheric private eye office bathed in dramatic film noir lighting, sharp shadows from slatted blinds cut across a cluttered desk and worn surroundings, evoking the classic style by 1940s film. A world-weary detective is sitting behind the desk. He is smoking a cigarette, slowly bringing it to his lips, inhaling, and exhaling a plume of smoke that drifts in the harsh, directional light. The scene is rendered in stark black and white, creating a high-contrast, cinematic mood. The camera holds a static medium shot focused on the detective, emphasizing the gritty texture and oppressive atmosphere."
```

Inference with prompt extend:

We provide a prompt extend model for MoviiGen1.1, which is a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model with our internal data. Model is available on ü§ó [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/ZuluVision/MoviiGen1.1_Prompt_Rewriter).

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/inference/generate.py --ckpt_dir ./MoviiGen1.1 --prompt "A beautiful woman in a red dress is walking on the street." --use_prompt_extend --prompt_extend_model ZuluVision/MoviiGen1.1_Prompt_Rewriter
```

Prompt Tips:

- **Prompt Length**: The prompt length should be around 100~200.
- **Prompt Content**: The prompt should contain **scene description**, **main subject**, **events**, **aesthetics description** and **camera movement**.
- **Example**: 
```
Scene Description: A smoky, atmospheric private eye office bathed in dramatic film noir lighting, sharp shadows from slatted blinds cut across a cluttered desk and worn surroundings, evoking the classic style by 1940s film.
Main Subject: A world-weary detective is sitting behind the desk.
Events: He is smoking a cigarette, slowly bringing it to his lips, inhaling, and exhaling a plume of smoke that drifts in the harsh, directional light.
Aesthetics Description: The scene is rendered in stark black and white, creating a high-contrast, cinematic mood.
Camera Movement: The camera holds a static medium shot focused on the detective, emphasizing the gritty texture and oppressive atmosphere.

Final Prompt:
A smoky, atmospheric private eye office bathed in dramatic film noir lighting, sharp shadows from slatted blinds cut across a cluttered desk and worn surroundings, evoking the classic style by 1940s film. A world-weary detective is sitting behind the desk. He is smoking a cigarette, slowly bringing it to his lips, inhaling, and exhaling a plume of smoke that drifts in the harsh, directional light. The scene is rendered in stark black and white, creating a high-contrast, cinematic mood. The camera holds a static medium shot focused on the detective, emphasizing the gritty texture and oppressive atmosphere.

## üõ†Ô∏è Training

### Training Framework

Our training framework is built on [FastVideo](https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/FastVideo), with custom implementation of sequence parallel to optimize memory usage and training efficiency. The sequence parallel approach allows us to distribute the computational load across multiple GPUs, enabling efficient training of large-scale video generation models.

#### Key Features:

- **Sequence Parallel & Ring Attention**: Our custom implementation divides the temporal dimension across multiple GPUs, reducing per-device memory requirements while maintaining model quality.
- **Efficient Data Loading**: Optimized data pipeline for handling high-resolution video frames (Latent Cache and Text Embedding Cache). 
- **Multi Resolution Training Bucket**: Support for training at multiple resolutions.
- **Mixed Precision Training**: Support for BF16/FP16 training to accelerate computation.
- **Distributed Training**: Seamless multi-node, multi-GPU training support.

### Data Preprocessing

We cache the videos and corresponding text prompts as latents and text embeddings to optimize the training process. This preprocessing step significantly improves training efficiency by reducing computational overhead during the training phase. You need to provide a **merge.txt** file to specify the dataset path. And the dataset should be a json like **training_data.json**. Finally, you will get **video_caption.json** which contains the latents and text embeddings paths. 

```bash
bash scripts/data_preprocess/preprocess.sh
```
Example Data Format:

**merge.txt**
```txt
relative_path_to_json_dir, training_data.json
```

**training_data.json**
```json
[
    {
        "cap": "your prompt",
        "path": "path/to/your/video.mp4",
        "resolution": {
            "width": 3840,
            "height": 2160
        },
        "fps": 23.976023976023978,
        "duration": 1.4180833333333331
    },
    ...
]
```

Output Json:

**video_caption.json**
```json
[
    {
        "latent_path": "path/to/your/latent.pt",
        "prompt_embed_path": "path/to/your/prompt_embed.pt",
        "length": 12
    },
    ...
]
```

### Train
```bash
bash scripts/train/finetune.sh
```

**When multi-node training, you need to set the number of nodes and the number of processes per node manually.** We provide a sample script for multi-node training.

```bash
bash scripts/train/finetune_multi_node.sh
```
